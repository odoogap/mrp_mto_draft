# MRP MTO Draft

## Overview

Allow the sales order line configurator to be edited for changes of product attributes on confirmed sales order, and on changes to product attributes reflected in related delivery orders and manufacturing orders as well.

## Purpose

Ability to change the product attributes of a confirmed sales order at any time of the process.

### Why we decide to provide this module?

Odoo standard does not allow to change product attributes on sales order lines on confirmation stage. We need to change the workflow in order to allow changes to product attributes on confirmed sales order.

## How to install

* Firstly, ensure that the module file is present in the add-ons directory of the Odoo server
